# Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Project

This repository contains a comprehensive study and analysis of the **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** system. The project was originally presented by **Anurag Sharma** under the supervision of **Yatendra Kumar Singh** and aims to educate on the fundamental building blocks, working, and applications of PLL circuits.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. It is widely used in telecommunications, computers, and other electronic applications.

This repository includes:
- Theoretical explanations
- Block diagrams
- Circuit-level schematics
- Historical background
- Applications and classifications
- Key parameters like lock-in range, capture range, and pull-in time
